BST: Ulysses Morgan
The BST Data Structure was used to store the Movies via the Secondary Key.
The movie title's string were inserted into the BST via ASCII Comparison.

Challenges Faced:
- Deleting a Movie and still preserving BST property. Movie(Node) to be deleted
  was propogated to the leaf, and the leaf's parent's respective child was deleted/pointed to null.

- Finding movies with the same Title was solved using a DFS search.
  Multiple movies with the same title was then extracted with the DFS search.
