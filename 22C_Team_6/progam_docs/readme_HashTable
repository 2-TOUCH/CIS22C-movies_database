Hash Table was implementing with linked list collision resolution.
Hash Table Data Structure was implemented to get a O(1) when searching for a movie.

Challenge:
Encountered a memory issue where we used "delete" where we should've used "delete[]." 
It resulted in a crash when exiting the program. The crash was fixed by using the correct "delete[]."`
